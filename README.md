For my mock start up project I had to create a responsive design that ensures web applications will render on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. 

My framework:

* First I created the following files files: `index.html`, and `style.css` with a basic HTML/CSS template. Then, using Bootstrap, I developed my  site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A find out more link that you can click on. It will take you to another page that has been set up using Mailchimp. 

   * You can add your email address, subscribe, and before you are allowed to subscribe you will need to confim your email address. 

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

   * I used the Bootstrap grid system to adjust my navbar.

Over all this was a fun project that really made me utilize bootstraps grid system, and introduced me to Mailchimp.
